# Python-Escape-Room
Basic text based escape room game using OOP in Python.

A small text based game I created to challenge and solidify my knowledge within Python.
The game requires the player to select items in the room and interact with them.
Each interaction outputs a clue that the player can use to determine the room code.
After 3 attempts at guessing the code the player loses.

I also created a sample test to check for any issues in my code and commented it out in the bottom.
